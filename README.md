Pattern making with python

Patterns can be printed in python using simple for loops. First outer loop is used to handle the number of rows and the Inner nested for loop is used to handle the number of columns. Manipulatingvprint statements and the range in for loops, different number patterns, alphabet patterns, or star patterns can be printed. 

Some of the Patterns are shown in this repo.
